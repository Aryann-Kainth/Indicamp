Add multiple images on an interactive carousel.

Just type in your location and your Campground  will show up on a map! This is done via the mapbox API which uses geocoding.

I used Starability CSS files to get a star based review .



The homepage has a cluster map with all the Campgrounds  which makes finding Campgrounds near your location easier
